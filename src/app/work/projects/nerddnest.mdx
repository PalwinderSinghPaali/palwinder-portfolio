## Overview

This project basically is a Live Gaming Streaming Platform developing in PERN Stack that is a combination of Youtube, Twitch and Instagram features which allows users to live stream, messaging, posts, interacting each other. Users can create and participate in regular events and much more.

## Key Features

- **Real-time messaging**: Users can interact each other through messaging functionality both individually and group, developed by integrating Socket.IO.
- **News Feed**: Real Time manually created News Feed functionality where users share videos, images, texts etc and can also schedule them to post it later.
- **Add a Friend**: It allows users to add each other, by sending requests to each other. While receiver can accept or reject requests. 
- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications of every new message, post, events etc. 
- **Live Events**: Users can create their own events for gaming based on interest and can also join other events happening all around the world. 

## Technologies Used

- **Node JS**: Powered the backend with a scalable and efficient runtime for handling requests
- **React and Next.js**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **PostgreSQL**: Used as the primary database for storing and querying trade data efficiently.
- **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and servers over WebSockets and fallback mechanisms.
- **Redis**: An in-memory data store used for caching, message brokering, and real-time data processing.
- **RTK (Redux Toolkit)**: A modern, efficient, and opinionated way to manage state in React apps with Redux.
- **AWS S3**: Scalable object storage service for storing and retrieving any amount of data securely.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was to create messaging and real-time notifications. For which I firstly researched and then Integrated Socket.IO for managing real-time chats, creating rooms for group chat and managing socket ids through redis.
