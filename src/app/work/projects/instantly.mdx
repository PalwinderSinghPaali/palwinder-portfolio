## Overview

In this project, I focused on converting figma design to responsive UI. Alongwith integrating email outreach and settings section. 

## Key Features

- **Integrated ShadCN**: Integrated ShadCN components for email inbox.
- **Email Outreach**: Converted figma design to executable code with tab based form selections views.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building modern, responsive UIs with minimal custom styling.
- **ShadCN**:  A collection of beautifully designed, accessible UI components built on Radix and Tailwind CSS for modern web apps.

## Challenges and Learnings

Challenges I faced in this was to convert design into tab based functionality from menu based previous design, without impacting the already integrated API's and flow.
