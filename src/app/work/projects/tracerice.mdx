- **Role Management**: Great user experience at each level of roles along with role privileges for each menu.

## Technologies Used

- **React and Next.js**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **Node JS**: Powered the backend with a scalable and efficient runtime for handling requests.
- **PostgreSQL**: Used as the primary database for storing and querying trade data efficiently.
- **AWS**: Provided scalable cloud infrastructure for hosting, storage, and deployment.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was managing data flow across multiple entities (Farmers, Procurement, Mandi, Mill, CMS, etc.) while ensuring accuracy. So, overcome those challenges by using leveraging indexed queries and caching significantly improved data retrieval speeds.
