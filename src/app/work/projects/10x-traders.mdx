## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was to create custom Trading Indicators like RSI, SMA, SSL etc. and then calculating Buy/Sell trades on different Forex Charts. To overcome this challenge I have done lot of researchs, converting mathematical calculations into executable algorithms, including converting pine scripts code to JS codes.
