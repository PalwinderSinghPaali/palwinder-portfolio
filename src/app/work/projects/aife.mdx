## Overview

In this project, I focused on building a comprehensive Art Gallery platform that helps artists discover unique artworks from talented artists. Browse our curated collection of contemporary art.

## Key Features

- **Stripe Integration**: Developed pricing tiers using stripe with monthly and yearly based subscription with 7 Days of Free Trial, It has Card, Apple Pay and Google Pay based payment methods with added on feature to cancel subscription any time.
- **Payload CMS**: Integrated Payload CMS for smoothless UI/UX handling using admin dasboard and Supabase. 
- **Supabase**: Module which provides Trading charts of different currencies, also have an added on feature to add different indicators like MACD, CCE,ATR, SMA, EMA, Aroon, and many more indicators.

## Technologies Used

- **Next JS**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **Payload CMS**: Integrated Payload CMS for smoothless UI/UX handling using admin dasboard and Supabase.
- **Supanase**: Used as the primary NoSQL database for flexible and efficient trade data storage.
- **Stripe**: Integrated for secure and seamless payment processing and subscription management.
- **Strapi**: Served as a headless CMS for managing and delivering dynamic content efficiently.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was to create custom components to add Bulk Products/Artworks create functionality which was against the laws of PayloadCMS.
