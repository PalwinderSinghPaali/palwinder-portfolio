## Overview

In this extension, I focused on building a comprehensive trading analysis platform that helps traders make data-driven decisions. The goal was to develop a seamless and interactive extension that provides real-time tool for backtesting above Trading View Charts.

## Key Features

- **Stripe Integration**: Developed pricing tiers using stripe with monthly and yearly based subscription with 7 Days of Free Trial, It has Card, Apple Pay and Google Pay based payment methods with added on feature to cancel subscription any time.
- **Backtester**: Backtesting tool to Input trades, and then calculate possible results with an option to save trades and their result like win loss ratio, PnL charts, %percentage of winning etc.
- **Automated Bactesting**: Module which provides Trading charts of different currencies, also have an added on feature to add different indicators like MACD, CCE,ATR, SMA, EMA, Aroon, and many more indicators.
- **Strategy Library**: This allows users to easily store and save all the backtesting data. After backtesting, simply click “save” and head to the strategy library. There, you can organize your backtest by category, color-code it, and even name it for easy reference.
- **P&L Calendar & Trade Journal**: Calender which provides ability to store their day to day progress with an option to store notes for the day.

## Technologies Used

- **Node JS**: Powered the backend with a scalable and efficient runtime for handling requests
- **React and Next.js**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **Mongo DB**: Used as the primary NoSQL database for flexible and efficient trade data storage.
- **Stripe**: Integrated for secure and seamless payment processing and subscription management.
- **Strapi**: Served as a headless CMS for managing and delivering dynamic content efficiently.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges while creating this extension was to make it available within a window instead of default popup behaviour. After going though chrome documentation and updating background scripts I overcame these challenges.
