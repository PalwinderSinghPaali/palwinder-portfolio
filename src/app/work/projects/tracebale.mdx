## Overview

In this project, I focused on automating the often tedious design handover process. The goal was to create a pipeline that converts Figma designs directly into clean, production-ready code. By integrating design tokens, component libraries, and automated workflows, this solution significantly reduced the time spent on translating design assets into code, while maintaining design consistency across the product.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Data Capture**: Provides near real-time data analytics and visualization dashboards, enabling brands to make informed and timely business decisions.
- **End-to-End Visibility**: TraceBale offers comprehensive tracking of cotton and raw materials from farm groups to finished products, ensuring transparency at every stage of the textile supply chain.
- **Hybrid Traceability Model**: Combines digital data tracking with physical DNA markers, allowing brands to trace products both digitally and physically across key supply chain stages.
- **Effective Onboarding & Support**: Provides an easy onboarding process, in-depth platform training, and a ticketing escalation matrix to connect users with the TraceBale team. 
- **Role Management**: Great user experience at each level of roles along with role privileges for each menu.

## Technologies Used

- **React and Next.js**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **Node JS**: For building seamless back-end functionalities.
- **PostgreSQL**: For managing .
- **AWS**: For seamless deployment and scaling.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was managing data flow across multiple entities (Farmers, Ginners, Spinners, Weavers, Brands) while ensuring accuracy. So, overcome those challenges by using leveraging indexed queries and caching significantly improved data retrieval speeds.

## Outcome

The automated Figma to code pipeline has streamlined the handoff process, cutting down design-to-development time by 40%. Designers now have more confidence that their designs will be accurately translated into code, and developers can focus on more complex logic and feature development. This project has proven the value of automation in bridging the gap between design and development.
