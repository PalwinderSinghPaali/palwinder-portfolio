## Overview

In this project, I focused on integrating IMDB and TMDB API sources. The goal was to create a site which gives user a destination to watch HD Movies & TV Shows online for free by integrating multiple video players.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Players**: Integrated multiple online movie streaming platforms for smooth experience.
- **Continue Watching**: Continue from where you have left off.
- **Favorites**: Mark your favorites movies or show to watch it later.

## Technologies Used

- **React and Next.js**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **Node JS**: Powered the backend with a scalable and efficient runtime for handling requests.
- **PostgreSQL**: Used as the primary database for storing and querying trade data efficiently.
- **Deployment**: Provided scalable cloud infrastructure for hosting, storage, and deployment.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.
- **Tanstack Query**: For managing state, to fetch and cache data throughout the application..

## Challenges and Learnings

Challenges here was to cache API data for perfect user experience. So, implemented Tanstack Query for caching and fetching third party API's for request limiting.
