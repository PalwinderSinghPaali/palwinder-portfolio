## Overview

In this project, I focused on automating the often tedious design handover process. The goal was to create a pipeline that converts Figma designs directly into clean, production-ready code. By integrating design tokens, component libraries, and automated workflows, this solution significantly reduced the time spent on translating design assets into code, while maintaining design consistency across the product.

## Key Features

- **Stripe Integration**: Developed pricing tiers using stripe with monthly and yearly based subscription with 7 Days of Free Trial, It has Card, Apple Pay and Google Pay based payment methods with added on feature to cancel subscription any time.
- **Backtester**: Backtesting tool to Input trades, and then calculate possible results with an option to save trades and their result like win loss ratio, PnL charts, %percentage of winning etc.
- **Automated Bactesting**: Module which provides Trading charts of different currencies, also have an added on feature to add different indicators like MACD, CCE,ATR, SMA, EMA, Aroon, and many more indicators.
- **Strategy Library**: This allows users to easily store and save all the backtesting data. After backtesting, simply click “save” and head to the strategy library. There, you can organize your backtest by category, color-code it, and even name it for easy reference.
- **P&L Calendar & Trade Journal**: Calender which provides ability to store their day to day progress with an option to store notes for the day.

## Technologies Used

- **Node JS**: For building seamless back-end functionalities.
- **React and Next.js**: For building the front-end codebase with clean, reusable components.
- **Mongo DB**: For managing .
- **Stripe**: For seamless payments and managing subscription.
- **Strapi**: For headless CMS.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing design changes to the repository.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that the generated code was clean and maintainable. This involved setting up intelligent mapping between Figma components and React code structures, as well as managing edge cases like responsive design and conditional rendering. Additionally, the continuous synchronization required a robust error-handling system to prevent conflicts during development.

## Outcome

The automated Figma to code pipeline has streamlined the handoff process, cutting down design-to-development time by 40%. Designers now have more confidence that their designs will be accurately translated into code, and developers can focus on more complex logic and feature development. This project has proven the value of automation in bridging the gap between design and development.
